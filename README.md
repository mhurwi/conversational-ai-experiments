Have fun talking with AI.

You will need 3 api keys:

- deepgram
- openai
- google

Make a `.env` file that resembles `.env.example` but using your actual api keys.

Install the dependencies by running `yarn install`.

Start the app by running `yarn rw dev`. The app will start running on `http://localhost:8910`.

The best example app is `Talk`, at `http://localhost:8910/talk`
